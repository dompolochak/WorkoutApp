# Easiest View
This project is currently hosted at [https://brave-banach-99c77e.netlify.app/?](https://brave-banach-99c77e.netlify.app/?) from there you can access all of the functionality of the application. The database is run on AWS and the backend Rest API is hosted on a [Heroku](www.heroku.com) server. All of which are connected to the above netlify link. I **highly** recommend using this method to view the application.

**The database to this application is no longer live, the client is still hosted but there is not data connection**

# How to run locally
This project is a React Web Application. To run, first download the latest version of `node.js`. The front-end and back-end **must** be in separate directories. After installing `node`, in the front-end directory run `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies that are outlined in `package.json`. Next run `npm start` to run the application on **localhost:3000**.  
Next you need to start the back-end. This again uses `node`. In the back-end directory run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies outlined in `package.json`. Then run `npm start` to run the back-end on **localhost:4000**.  
From here the program should be running fully on **localhost:3000**
